# Introduction

## What is *Mesh-Finland*

**Mesh-Finland** is the current working name for a loose collaboration of [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/introduction/) users in Finland

* The collaboration is not in a position to dictate what anyone does when it comes to acceptable and legal use of ISM frequencies or the internet
* The collaboration is not currently represented by a legal entity

## Current goals are as follows:
