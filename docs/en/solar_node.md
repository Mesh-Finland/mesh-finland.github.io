## Battery Protection

Battery protection is important to ensure their safe use. Here are some tips and recommendations for battery protection:

### Fuse Installation

Fuses are important for protecting batteries from overload and overheating. The installation of fuses depends on the number of batteries and their intended use.

- **Thermal Fuse:** A thermal fuse should be installed somewhere near the battery to ensure that it reacts quickly if the battery overheats. The choice of installation location may vary, but it is important to ensure that the fuse is easily accessible and can quickly cut off the power from the battery in case of overheating.

- **Resettable Fuse:** The number of resettable fuses, or thermal cutoffs, depends on the number of batteries and their environment. A common recommendation is to install one fuse for every two battery groups, ensuring that batteries are not charged if they are too hot.

Remember to check the manufacturer's recommendations for batteries and follow safety instructions for fuse installation and use.

## Instructions and Recommendations

### Fuse Selection

The values of fuses depend entirely on the batteries used, and the values should be checked from the battery specifications. Generally, it is advisable to choose a fuse size slightly larger than the maximum capacity of the battery, but not too large. The fuse can also be smaller than the battery maximum if additional protection is desired.

### Battery Connection

It is recommended to avoid directly soldering batteries together. Instead, consider using spot welding or battery holders designed for cells with contacts. This reduces the risk of damaging batteries and improves safety.

### Battery Handling and Maintenance

- **Storage:** Batteries should be stored in a dry and cool place. Avoid direct sunlight and high temperatures.
- **Charging:** Use only chargers suitable for the batteries. Avoid overcharging and monitor the battery temperature during charging.
- **Usage:** Avoid fully discharging the battery, as it can shorten the battery's lifespan. Keep an eye on the voltage level of batteries with regular checks.
